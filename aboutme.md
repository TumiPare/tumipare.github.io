### My story

There isn't much to say about me. I live in Pretoria, South Africa. I have lived here, almost all my life, only ever exciting to see some of my extended family in the Western Cape, or Limpopo. The only other reason why I would be out of Pretoria is if I am out on holiday. It has been my desire to explore the world and meet new people and see new places! But life's been hitting me hard and I don't have the cash for anything extravagant currently. However, I have started working (remotly) at a company here in South Africa, Psyergate. I've been working as a juniour java developer intern for a year now. I'm also completing my honours at the University of Pretoria.
