I have never been one to blog, but recently I have acquired the desire to write and let out my thoughts to the open. Although, I don't expect this to make an impact to others, it's a great way for me to organise my thoughts. And of course, it fulfils my desire to speak out, out to the unknown! Lol, I haven't watched Frozen, but I think I have heard it enough times sung muffled by my girlfriend. 

Stick around, and read if you have an interest!
